# Seismic wiggle discriminator aka the Amy2000
This is a project developed by team Wiggle from the [2019 Geohack Week](https://geohackweek.github.io/) at the University of Washington. 

The scope of the Wiggle project has two goals. 1) Test the [Generalized Phase Detection](https://github.com/interseismic/generalized-phase-detection) (GDP), which was trained on Southern California events, using [Pacific Northwest Seismic Network](https://pnsn.org) (PNSN) event data. 2) Train the GDP with the following event types:
* Surface Events
* Explosions
* Thunder
* Sonic Shockwave

# Data
Arrival data were querried from the pick data in the PNSN AQMS database. Pick data were then used to download the channel data from [IRIS](https://iris.edu)
